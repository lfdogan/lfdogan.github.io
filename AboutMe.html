<p>I'm a user exeperience researcher/engineer currently living near Rochester NY in the Finger Lakes region of the state. I started out working in psychology-based research for the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. I enjoyed working with study participants and with their data. This introduced me to an interest in working with computers so I sought out a master's degree in information science while I continued working at the university. </p>
        <p>About a year ago I was looking at the bookshelf of dusty photo albums and thinking about how we've moved from hand-held albums to digital albums. I still like the idea of having an album full of photos from a particular vacation and I felt that the computer wasn't quite doing them justice. I really wanted to share my photos with friends and family who were visiting. So, I started creating a digital photo album, added music, added videos, and cover art to access on my streaming device. It was great because my family absolutely loved watching a 3 minute video of their vacation.</p>
        <p>After realizing my new interest was in the user experience, I took a course to learn these skills. I enjoy all aspects of the process but I've realized that I favor research. I really enjoy the research of determining how to improve a product's website performance. </p>
