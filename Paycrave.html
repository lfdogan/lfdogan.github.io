        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Food trucks are a great place to get lunch in a city, unfortunately there is no unifed way to pre-order, read reviews, or pay with a credit card. This mobile application will provide users a way to view these trucks on a map and submit orders.</p>
        
        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>For this project, I was given the style tile for the company and the task of creating this application so that users could search for nearby trucks, view and create reviews, view and order from menus, and pay by credit card.</p>
        
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Some research needed to be done to determine what was important to people who would possibly use this application. I created user stories for three potential people. A college student wants to find the least expensive food truck, wants to sort out the types of food he doesn't like, and wants a way to repeat an order. A patrolling police officer wants the fastest way to check out and what is nearest him. An office worker wants to view food trucks with high ratings.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <a href="projects/paycrave/UserFlowDiagram.png"><img alt="Paycrave" src="projects/paycrave/UserFlowDiagram.png"></a>
        <p>I ran competitive analysis on Lyft and Uber taxi services, designed a user flow diagram, and ran a few user tests. My user tests determined what features are most important and I found that the priority would be to find food trucks near the user, so this should be the opening screen. Then I tested different pin options. I found that the most useful information to have on the pin head was the average rating which would be relatd to the color of the pin with the darkest pin being the best rated.</p>
